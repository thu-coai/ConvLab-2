# SVMNLU on camrest

SVMNLU build a classifier for each semantic tuple (intent-slot-value) based on n-gram features. It's first proposed by [Mairesse et al. (2009)](http://mairesse.s3.amazonaws.com/research/papers/icassp09-final.pdf). We adapt the implementation from [pydial](https://bitbucket.org/dialoguesystems/pydial/src/master/semi/CNetTrain/).

- For each semantic tuple (intent-slot-value) that has limited value, such as `(Hotel-Request, Addr, ?)` and `(Hotel-Inform, Internet, [yes|no])`, an SVM classifier is applied directly.
- If the semantic tuple (intent-slot-value) may have many value, such as Hotel-Name and Hotel-Addr, we use an SVM classifier `(INTENT, SLOT, GENERAL)` for all tuples that have same intent and slot but different value. When a new sentence come, we identify these value using the ontology.

## Usage

Determine which data you want to use: if **mode**='usr', use user utterances to train; if **mode**='sys', use system utterances to train; if **mode**='all', use both user and system utterances to train.

#### Preprocess data

On `svm/camrest` dir:

```sh
$ python preprocess.py [mode]
```

output processed data on `data/[mode]_data` dir.

#### Train a model

On `svm` dir:

```sh
$ PYTHONPATH=../../.. python train.py camrest/configs/camrest_[mode].cfg
```

Please refer to `svm/config.md` for how to write config file (`*.cfg`)

The model will be saved on `model/svm_camrest_[mode].pickle`. Also, it will be zipped as `model/svm_camrest_[mode].zip`. 

Trained models can be download on: 

- Trained on all data: [mode=all](https://convlab.blob.core.windows.net/convlab-2/svm_camrest_all.zip)
- Trained on user utterances only: [mode=usr](https://convlab.blob.core.windows.net/convlab-2/svm_camrest_usr.zip)
- Trained on system utterances only: [mode=sys](https://convlab.blob.core.windows.net/convlab-2/svm_multiwoz_usr.zip)

#### Evaluate

On `svm/camrest` dir:

```sh
$ PYTHONPATH=../../../.. python evaluate.py [mode]
```

#### Predict

In `nlu.py` , the `SVMNLU` class inherits the NLU interface and adapts to camrest dataset. Example usage:

```python
from convlab2.nlu.svm.camrest import SVMNLU

model = SVMNLU()
dialog_act = model.predict(utterance)
```

You can refer to `evaluate.py` for specific usage.

## Data

We use the multiwoz data (`data/camrest/[train|val|test].json.zip`).

## Performance

`mode` determines the data we use: if mode=`usr`, use user utterances to train; if mode=`sys`, use system utterances to train; if mode=`all`, use both user and system utterances to train.

We evaluate the precision/recall/f1 of predicted dialog act.

| mode | Precision | Recall | F1    |
| ---- | --------- | ------ | ----- |
| usr  | 64.53     | 74.52  | 69.16 |
| sys  | 47.20     | 45.57  | 46.37 |
| all  | 55.95     | 59.03  | 57.45 |
